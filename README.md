# MythosMachina – The Code Behind the Legend

**MythosMachina** is a free and open development collective focused on building **AI-supportive tools** and **creative dev utilities**.  
We are small now—but like every legend, we grow with time, learning together and forging new ideas.

Our mission is to craft software that empowers developers, creators, and AI enthusiasts alike.  
From dataset pipelines to toolkits and experimental prototypes—MythosMachina is where code becomes myth.

**New members are always welcome. Join us, and help shape the machine behind the myth.**
